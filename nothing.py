"""CSC148 Assignment 1 - Simulation

=== CSC148 Fall 2023 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module description ===
This contains the main Simulation class that is actually responsible for
creating and running the simulation. You'll also find the function run_example_simulation
here at the bottom of the file, which you can use as a starting point to run
your simulation on a small configuration.

Note that we have provided a fairly comprehensive list of attributes for
Simulation already. You may add your own *private* attributes, but should not
modify/remove any of the existing attributes.
